#  Dashboards for Operational Business Management with Looker

## Project Overview
This project showcases **interactive dashboards** built-in Looker for **real-time business operations monitoring**.  
The dashboards provide live **sales and operational margins** data which supports sales, procurement, logistics and marketing activities, helping improve decision-making and streamline business processes.

## Visualisations
- Monthly sales visualisation reflects **month-to-date** data to inform on monthly sales vs plan or KPIs
- Suppliers dashboard shows **year-to-date** sales in total, in the number of truckloads, and average **operational margin per supplier**. The latter metric is vital in B2B wholesales of commodities and hugely supports sourcing and supplier management. 
- Top 10 customers **year-to-date** supports sales and marketing activities.
